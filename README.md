# üìò Design Patterns Cheat Sheet (Usage-Focused)

## üß± Creational Patterns

| Pattern            | Real-World Analogy                     | When to Use |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Singleton**       | Printer spooler / global config        | You need one shared instance |
| **Factory Method**  | Pizza store creates different types    | You want subclasses to decide what to instantiate |
| **Abstract Factory**| Furniture set (modern vs victorian)   | You need to create related objects as a family |
| **Builder**         | Assembling a custom PC or burger       | You want to construct complex objects step-by-step |
| **Prototype**       | Copying a resume and modifying it      | You want to clone existing objects efficiently |

## üîß Structural Patterns

| Pattern            | Real-World Analogy                     | When to Use |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Adapter**         | Plug adapter                          | Interface mismatch between classes |
| **Decorator**       | Wrapping a gift or coffee order        | Add behavior dynamically to objects |
| **Proxy**           | Acting agent or bouncer                | Control access or add lazy loading/caching |
| **Facade**          | Universal TV remote                    | Simplify a complex subsystem |
| **Composite**       | Folder system (files within folders)   | Work with tree structures uniformly |
| **Bridge**          | Remote controls work across devices    | Decouple abstraction from implementation |
| **Flyweight**       | Emojis / characters reuse              | Reduce memory usage with shared instances |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Behavioral Patterns

| Pattern            | Real-World Analogy                     | When to Use |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Command**         | Remote control commands                | Encapsulate requests (queue, undo, log) |
| **Observer**        | YouTube subscriptions                  | Notify many when state changes |
| **Strategy**        | Changing route in Google Maps          | Select algorithm at runtime |
| **State**           | Mario changing form                    | Object behavior changes with state |
| **Template Method** | Baking a cake with a recipe            | Fixed steps with variation in some |
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Call center support            | Pass request through handlers |
| **Mediator**        | Chatroom / air traffic control         | Centralize communication |
| **Memento**         | Save game / Undo feature               | Restore object to previous state |
| **Visitor**         | Insurance adjuster visiting properties | Perform operations without modifying classes |
| **Interpreter**     | Rule engine / SQL parsing              | Interpret language or expression grammar |
